The present world scenario is changed regarding business, traveling, and education. Rapid global dissemination and the high mortality rate of coronaviruses are the greatest challenges for drug developers. It will be moving forward toward the identification and treatment of emerging coronaviruses with the aid of nanotechnology. The COVID-19 pandemic raised the question of researchers’ capability to manage this dilemma in a short period. In the present review, we described how hallow material could be developed as a pro-drug that shows an excellent therapeutic effect. Hollow nanoparticles that exploration of antiviral or diagnostic agents against emerging coronaviruses. Hollow nanomaterials in vaccine development are essential because hollow nanocomposites are suitable for mimicking viral structures and antigen delivery. A biosensor that generates a signal from a transducer for comparing and analyzing biological conjugates such as cell receptors, antibodies, RNA, DNA, and nucleic acids. Different biosensors, such as graphene-based biosensors, nanoplasmonic sensor chips, nanomaterial biosensors, electrochemical biosensors, dual modality biosensors, and optical biosensors, have several advantages, characteristics, and a wide range of applications, most remarkably in medical treatment and are used for monitoring and diagnosis. This review focuses on modern experimental studies to identify intelligent and innovative bio/nanomaterials and matrices for developing targeted and controlled drug release systems, nanosensors and nanovaccines to combat pathogenic viruses.","",""

AbstractIn 2003 the National Council to Prevent Discrimination was created in Mexico with the purpose of eradicating exclusionary attitudes as well as studying their orientations and trends. With this body the definition of discrimination is institutionalized as the alienation of rights based on diverse prejudices. This document intends to analyze roughly the discriminatory tendencies in informants from Hidalgo based on the 2010 National Discrimination Survey in a descriptive, comparative and multifactoral manner; as well as more visible expressions in the media between 2010 and 2018 in order to offer an overview.Keywords: Discrimination, Hidalgo, México, Printed media, National Survey of discrimination.
